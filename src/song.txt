Disney - So This Is Love 
So this is love, hmm 
So this is love 
So this is what makes life divine 
I'm all aglow, hmm 
And now I know 
The key to all heaven is mine 
My heart has wings, hmm 
And I can fly 
I'll touch every star in the sky 
So this is the miracle 
That I've been dreaming of 
Hmm, hmm 
So this is love
